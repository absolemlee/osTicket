# osTicket Next.js Demo

This folder contains a minimal Next.js setup showing how the osTicket frontend could be reimplemented.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start Next.js on `http://localhost:3000`.

Currently only the landing page and a placeholder ticket form are implemented.
